## A brief intro to _What is IOT?_
*The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is at the epicenter of the Digital Transformation Revolution that is changing the shape of business, enterprise and people’s lives. This transformation influences everything from how we manage and operate our homes to automating processes across nearly all industries.The following image will give us a better picture of IoT* <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91836479/136671233-fc09dfe1-8324-4423-98a1-829520fd84d1.jpg">
